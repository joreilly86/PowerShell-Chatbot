# Chatbot for Visually Impaired Professionals üöÄ

## Project Overview üìñ

This chatbot is a simple yet powerful tool designed to assist visually impaired professionals, with a focus on civil engineering in this example. However, its versatile nature allows it to be easily adapted for various fields. It leverages OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate accurate and context-aware responses. A standout feature of this chatbot is its ability to automatically copy responses to the clipboard, enhancing usability for visually impaired users.
